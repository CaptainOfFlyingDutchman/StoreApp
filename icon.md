### How to integrate icons

1. Install the required npm modules globally using the command `npm install -g yo generator-rn-toolbox`.
2. Make sure in your path you have ImageMagick binaries can be found at [http://www.imagemagick.org/](http://www.imagemagick.org/). If you are Linux machine then most probably you have those installed already. Linux is recommended by the way.
3. Inside your app folder execute the command `yo rn-toolbox:assets --icon icon.png`. **icon.png** should be in the current directory.
4. Overwrite any files it asks.
